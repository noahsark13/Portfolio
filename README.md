This portfolio is intended to showcase some of my work throughout my college carreer, mainly that with Object Oriented Programming languages such as C# (which most of my code consists of).

The "DungeonCode" folder contains the direct cs files that I personally worked on within my last academic group project "Beat the Dungeon".

The "Algorithms" folder contains various programs that display my knowledge in the creation and implementation of data structures, as well as my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.

Everything else included are various Unity and HTML/CSS Projects
