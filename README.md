This portfolio is intended to showcase my current programming proficiency, mainly that with Object Oriented Programming languages such as C# (which most of my code consists of).

The "DungeonCode" folder contains the direct cs files that I personally worked on within my last academic group project "Beat the Dungeon". You can also find a video of actual gameplay in the same folder.

The "Algorithms" folder contains various programs that display my knowledge in the creation and implementation of data structures, as well as my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.
