# My Portfolio

The "DungeonCode" folder contains the direct cs files that I personally worked on within my last academic group project "Beat the Dungeon". You can also view the full game within the "BeatTheDungeonFull" folder.

The "Algorithms" folder contains various programs that display my knowledge in creation and implementation of data structures, as well as my understanding of algorithmic problem solving.
