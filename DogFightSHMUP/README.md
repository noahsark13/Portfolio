## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: I plan for the game to be viewed directly from above.
-   Camera Movement: Camera does not move, but gameplay looks as if the camera is flying along side the plane.
-   Player Health: A healthbar that indicates damage to the hull, there will be ways to fix it by picking up items mid game.
-   End Condition: The game goes on infinitely, scaling in difficulty until the player eventually dies.
-   Scoring: Destroying enemy pilots, picking up debris, and completion of a phase.

### Game Description

World War II styled SHMUP based around dodging the attacks of enemy dog fighters as you traverse the skies of a raging conflict. Take to the skies and fight for freedom: score points by destroying enemy combatants, upgrade your fighter jet with salvaged scrap, hone your flight skills as the stakes increase every round, and fight until your last breath. Do you have what it takes to be an ace pilot?

## You Additions

"Wind" mechanic that constantly pushes the user backwards. Some really smooth niceness when you hold d, you will gradually get slower as you approach a certain x value.
A upgrade system that initiates at the end of every round. You can upgrade your max health, attack speed, and your base damage. To upgrade you utilize a currency called "scrap" that has a 30% chance to drop from all enemies.
A healing mechanic that comes from picking up a different droppable item called cogs.
