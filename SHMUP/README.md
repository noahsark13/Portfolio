# Project BOMBS AWAY

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

### Student Info

-   Name: Noah Kasper
-   Section: 04

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: I plan for the game to eventually be viewed from the side (when I find good assets).
-   Camera Movement: Camera does not move, but gameplay looks as if the camera is flying along side the plane.
-   Player Health: A healthbar that indicates damage to the hull, there will be ways to fix it by picking up items mid game.
-   End Condition: The game goes on infinitely, scaling in difficulty until the player eventually dies.
-   Scoring: Destroying enemy pilots, picking up debris, and completion of a phase.

### Game Description

World War II styled SHMUP based around dodging the attacks of enemy dog fighters as you traverse the skies of a raging conflict. Take to the skies and fight for freedom: score points by destroying enemy combatants, upgrade your fighter jet with salvaged scrap, hone your flight skills as the stakes increase every round, and fight until your last breath. Do you have what it takes to be an ace pilot?


### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: W

    -   Left: S
    -   Right: D

## You Additions

Unique enemies and projectiles that interact with the player differently as you progress further in the game. If I have enough time I'd like to implement a simple upgrade system that enhances the players plane: different weapons, extra armor, etc
