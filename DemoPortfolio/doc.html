    <h2>Goal: </h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my website is to create a simple yet standout portfolio hand crafted by myself. I intend my audience to be potentially employers or simply people who enjoy my work.
        When you visit my page I want you to get to know who I am, thus everything on this webpage from the layout, to the color scheme, will represent a part of me. Since at this time I have only
        just finished the build to spec, I have no gotten the chance to add any individualzied aspects. However, I chose this web concept because of its simple and easy to follow layout,
        something I wish to replicate onto my final project. 
    </p>

    <h2>Other notes: </h2>
    <p>
        I am pretty satisfied with my current build to spec portion of the project. However, I do feel I overused flexbox. I basically didn't use grid at all, and it may be because
        I find it a bit more confusing. In my next iteration I want to change the gallery portion to a grid, instead of a flexbox of 3 flexboxes. I originally chose that route because
        I was having a hard time setting up the blocks within the grid to be different sizes. I'm sure there is a way to achieve the same look with a single grid area, I just need to spend
        more time experimenting and reading the syntax.

        <br><br>

        I've decided I like this layout, I put a lot of effort into my spec so I'm only going to change minor things to enhance the page. I like the color scheme, so I most likely
        wont change that. I think I will rework my actually gallery portion to highlight my biggest projects and have room for a description.

        <br><br>

        After just finishing my Project 1, I think I'm pretty satisfied with the outcome. I feel there is much more I could of implemented with us of JavaScript, perhaps I can make
        future additions. I couldn't find a "css validator" that functioned correctly for some reason so my css may be kind of messy. It is ALOT, but I think I organized my css atleast
        half decently.
